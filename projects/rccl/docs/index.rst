******************
RCCL documentation
******************

The ROCm Communication Collectives Library (RCCL) (pronounced "rickle") is an open-source, host-initiated library enabling collective communications executed via GPU -- it also
supports direct send/receive operations. RCCL supports collective algorithms across multiple processes/nodes via networking using Infiniband Verbs or TCP/IP sockets. RCCL is forked from
the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL); RCCL maintains an identical API library to NCCL. 

The RCCL public repository is located within the rocm-systems repo at `<https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/rccl>`_.
