RCCL release notes
==================

RCCL (ROCm Collective Communication Library) is AMD's implementation of the
NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) API. Each RCCL release targets
compatibility with one or more NCCL versions. Applications built against NCCL
can run on AMD hardware with no source-level changes.

The table below maps each ROCm release to the corresponding RCCL version and
the NCCL version or versions it is compatible with.

RCCL 2.30.4 for ROCm 7.14.0
-----------------------------

This release adds compatibility with NCCL 2.30.4, 2.29.7, and 2.28.9, and
introduces a new Python API, symmetric-memory kernels for MI450, and a proxy
diagnostics framework.

Added
^^^^^

- NCCL compatibility: 2.30.4, 2.29.7, 2.28.9.
- ``proxytrace`` profiler plugin and core proxy-diagnostics hooks
  (``RCCL_PROXYTRACE``).
- ``ncclBarrierSession`` LSA validation for barrier sessions.
- Symmetric-memory ReduceScatter kernel (``RailA2A_LsaLD``) on gfx942 and
  gfx950.
- Bias (accumulation) AllReduce on gfx1250 (MI450).
- Optimized scale-up ReduceScatter, AllGather, and AllToAll kernels.
- ROCProfiler-SDK (rocprofiler-sdk) coverage for ``ncclCommGrow`` and
  ``ncclCommGetUniqueId``.
- P2P batching auto-enabled for gfx950 combined with non-AINIC NICs.
- HIP/ROCm runtime version display in ``NCCL_DEBUG`` output.
- Python API bindings under ``bindings/nccl4py/``: a Cython-based interface to
  RCCL collectives, a ``cuda.core`` HIP shim for ROCm hosts, and RCCL-only
  wrappers for ``ncclAllReduceWithBias`` and ``ncclAllToAllv``.
- RCCL examples added to the repository.
- ``RCCL host API`` pull-in from NCCL 2.30.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- WarpSpeed auto mode enabled for grow communicators.
- Hierarchical AllGather now enabled by default for multi-node. Algorithm
  selection logic was refactored.
- Legacy ``net_ib`` replaced with the ``net_ib`` implementation from NCCL 2.29.
- Bootstrap AllGather now uses the bidirectional ring (N/2 steps) by default
  on the socket out-of-band (OOB) path. ``NCCL_BOOTSTRAP_BIDIR_ALLGATHER``
  now defaults to ``1``; set it to ``0`` to revert to the unidirectional ring.
- ``NCCL_PXN_C2C`` remains default-off (``0``). Upstream NCCL defaults it to
  ``1`` since 2.28; the C2C proxy-to-proxy cross-node (PXN) routing path is
  NVIDIA-specific and does not apply to AMD hardware.

Removed
^^^^^^^

- NPKit profiling support (``ENABLE_NPKIT`` build option, related headers,
  device and proxy instrumentation, ``--npkit-enable`` install flag). Use the
  profiler plugin API instead.
- Kernel COLLTRACE support (``COLLTRACE`` build option, device-side collective
  trace buffers, debug kernel variants). The host latency profiler is unchanged.
- Legacy ``ENABLE_PROFILING`` device profiling (``PROFILE`` build option). Use
  the profiler plugin API instead.

Resolved issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed ``ncclCommGrow`` channel-count divergence causing incorrect collective
  routing.
- Fixed ``ncclCommGrow`` hang when growing to an 8-rank single-node
  communicator.
- Fixed symmetric LDS under-reservation in legacy (non-device-linker) builds.
- Fixed LL128 protocol correctness for gfx1250 (MI450).
- Fixed XGMI topology mapping for multi-system (NPS) nodes.
- Fixed gfx950 collective hang from a tuner race condition.
- Fixed ``net_ib_cast``: CTS offload path now gated on per-connection state.
- Fixed ``net_ib``: non-fatal Isend CTS no-match no longer flagged as fatal.
- Fixed acquire-tail polling for gfx950 P2P host staging.
- Fixed LDS overflow in device-linker builds.
- Fixed ``ncclCommFree`` to release symmetric window objects automatically
  (NCCL 2.29.7 defect).
- Fixed static build failing with ``install(EXPORT "rccl-targets" ...)`` when
  ``fmt`` is fetched via ``FetchContent``.
- Fixed proxy channel staging buffers ignoring GDR mode selection on HIP <
  7.12 builds. Workaround for affected builds: ``NCCL_DMABUF_ENABLE=0``.
- Fixed RCCL initialization failing with ``Failed to find ROCm runtime
  library`` on runtime-only ROCm trees that have no unversioned
  ``libhsa-runtime64.so`` symlink. The ``RCCL_ROCR_PATH`` override is no
  longer needed and has been removed.

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- On gfx90a (MI210, MI250, MI250X) with ROCm 7.13 or later, per-launch
  scratch-memory reclaim in the runtime degrades RCCL performance. Set
  ``HSA_NO_SCRATCH_RECLAIM=1`` to restore performance.
- Elastic-buffer support for GIN compiles on ROCm but is unverified on AMD
  hardware.

----

RCCL 2.28.3 for ROCm 7.13
---------------------------

This release adds CAST network transport for AMD AINIC hardware, a built-in
CSV tuner, and multi-node hierarchical AllGather for MI350.

Added
^^^^^

- CAST network transport (``ncclNetCast`` / ``net_ib_cast``) for AMD AINIC
  (AMD Integrated Network Interface Controller) hardware.
- Built-in CSV tuner for runtime algorithm, protocol, and channel selection
  without rebuilds.
- Multi-node hierarchical AllGather for MI350, enabled by default for 8 or
  more nodes (64 MB threshold at 8 nodes, 128 MB above). Disable with
  ``RCCL_HIERARCHICAL_ALLGATHER=0``.
- Initial symmetric-memory kernel support on gfx942 and gfx950.
- ``RCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_THRESHOLD`` to split payload across multiple QPs/NICs
  in ``ncclIbMultiSend``.
- User Buffer and Graph Registration (``NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE`` / CUMEM) gated on
  Linux kernel version.
- Copy Engine (CE) collectives support.
- gfx1250 (MI450) GPU target support in RCCL and RCCL-Tests.
- Strix-Halo (gfx1151) tuning support.
- ``RCCL_IB_P2P_DISABLE_CTS`` to disable CTS (clear-to-send) offload for P2P
  connections on AINIC (defaults to ``1``, disabled).
- ``RCCL_CTS_INLINE_DATA`` merged into ``RCCL_CTS_OFFLOAD_ENABLED`` as a
  tri-state: ``-1`` (auto-enable on AINIC), ``0`` (force disable), ``1``
  (force enable).

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Removed MSCCL and MSCCL++ collective integration. The legacy
  ``mscclLoadAlgo``, ``mscclRunAlgo``, and ``mscclUnloadAlgo`` APIs remain as
  no-ops for link compatibility.
- P2P batching disabled by default on MI350.
- AMD-SMI (``amdsmi_init``) disabled by default due to a concurrency issue;
  enable explicitly for ROCm 7.0 and above when the issue is resolved.
- ``RCCL_ENABLE_CONTEXT_TRACKING`` replaced by ``NCCL_LAUNCH_ORDER_IMPLICIT``
  for controlling launch-order tracking.
- Tuning log messages moved from ``NCCL_INIT`` to the ``NCCL_TUNING`` debug
  subsystem.
- 256 threads per block on gfx950 (previously 512).
- Algorithm set to Ring for Navi4x (gfx1100/gfx1101) AllReduce.

Resolved issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed ``netOverride`` being skipped when rail-optimized trees are enabled.
- Fixed RCCL Inspector plugin teardown segfault/hang and collective-count
  correctness.
- Fixed ``ncclGroupSimulateEnd`` planner state leak and resource cleanup.
- Fixed validation errors with ``all_reduce_bias`` kernel on gfx950.
- Fixed ``--generate-sym-kernels`` option when used with ``--device-linker``.
- Fixed ``CUCHECK`` and ``CUCHECKGOTO`` macros to clear the HIP error state
  before returning.
- Fixed CTS-offload corner cases in ``net_ib_rocm`` and ``net_ib_cast``.

----

RCCL 2.28.3 for ROCm 7.12
---------------------------

This release adds AMD AINIC support, Direct ReduceScatter, and WarpSpeed for
single-node AllGather and ReduceScatter.

Added
^^^^^

- gfx1151 (Strix-Halo) GPU target support.

- AMD-SMI wrapper for firmware version queries (switched from rocm-smi to
  amd-smi).

Changed
^^^^^^^

- GPU Direct RDMA (remote direct memory access) mode selection now prefers
  peermem over DMAbuf by default. ``NCCL_DMABUF_ENABLE`` now defaults to
  ``1``. Set ``RCCL_FORCE_ENABLE_DMABUF=1`` to force DMAbuf exclusively.
- P2P batching node-count cap removed; P2P batching now applies at all node
  counts.
- Default maximum channels set to 48 for gfx950 and MI350 multi-node
  collectives.
- ``NCCL_LAUNCH_ORDER_IMPLICIT`` replaces ``RCCL_ENABLE_CONTEXT_TRACKING``.

Resolved issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed shutdown ordering race condition and use-after-free crash in proxy
  cleanup.
- Fixed DMAbuf support check failure (SWDEV-579889 / ROCM-2855).
- Fixed ``qpIndex`` selection in ``ncclIbIrecv`` for AINIC mode.
- Fixed per-device UD (unreliable datagram) map indexing for NIC fusion
  configurations.
- Fixed bfloat16 reduce kernel bug for ROCm 6.0 and later.
- Fixed memory leak in ``ncclCommInitRankFunc``.
- Fixed memory leaks (ROCM-1721, ROCM-1722).

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The upstream one-sided RMA (remote memory access) subsystem (``src/rma``) is
  unverified at scale on ROCm.
- The upstream Copy-Engine collective redesign is not adopted; RCCL retains its
  existing HIP Copy-Engine implementation.
- The Copy-Engine profiler path (``ncclProfiler_v6``) is not enabled; RCCL
  remains on ``ncclProfiler_v5``.
- GIN GDAKI host support is DOCA/Mellanox-specific and is unverified on AMD
  NICs.
- GIN GET and FLUSH (``iget``/``iflush``) are not implemented in the RCCL
  InfiniBand GIN proxy backend.
- Elastic-buffer support for GIN compiles on ROCm but is unverified on AMD
  hardware.

----

RCCL 2.28.3 for ROCm 7.11

- ``RCCL_IB_QPS_PER_P2P`` is now settable separately from
  ``NCCL_IB_QPS_PER_CONNECTION`` (backported from ROCm 7.1.0; noted here for
  completeness).
- WarpSpeed auto mode (``RCCL_WARP_SPEED_AUTO``): reduces CU count by 50% on
  a single node for AllReduce, AllGather from 64 MB, and ReduceScatter from
  256 MB.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- PIX and PXB treated as equivalent GDR distances for more consistent topology
  detection.

variables for P2P and IB tuning.

Added
^^^^^

- NCCL compatibility: 2.27.7.
- ``RCCL_IB_QPS_PER_P2P``: sets the number of queue pairs (QPs) per
